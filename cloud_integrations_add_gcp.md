### Adding a GCP Integration

Adding a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration requires establishing a trust relationship between GCP and Wavefront. You do that by creating a service account, giving that account viewer privileges, and downloading a JSON key. Click **How to get the JSON key** and follow the instructions on the left.

### Required Permissions

Minimum required permissions you need depend on the services you are using.

See [Google Cloud Platform Overview and Permissions](http://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_gcp_overview.html) for details.
