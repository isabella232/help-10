### Integrations

All integrations include an overview of how the integration is implemented and setup instructions for installing and configuring software required for the integration implementation.

Most of the integrations also have metrics and content:

- **Metrics** 
    
    Metrics sent by the integration and the rate that the integration is sending metrics. The **Metrics** tab contains the list of the collected metrics. 

- **Content** 
   - Pre-defined dashboards that highlight important metrics or illustrate techniques for querying metrics. Some dashboards contain pre-defined alert conditions that are embedded as queries in charts on the dashboards. You can install and uninstall the dashboards.
   - Pre-defined alerts - system alerts that you can preview before setting up the integration. You can install and uninstall the predefined alerts only if you have the **Alerts** permission.
