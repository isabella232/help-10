### Adding a Kubernetes Cluster

Adding a Kubernetes cluster for monitoring requires deploying a **Wavefront proxy** and **Wavefront Collector** inside your Kubernetes cluster. Click an option on the left to select where you want to install the Wavefront Collector for Kubernetes.

You have three choices:

* Install in Tanzu Cluster.
* Install in Kubernetes Cluster.
* Install in OpenShift Cluster.

Once you decide where you want to install the Wavefront Collector, follow the instructions on the left. For Tanzu and Kubernetes clusters, you can choose between simple Helm install or manual installation. For OpenShift cluster, you have different steps depending on your OpenShift Enterprise version.
