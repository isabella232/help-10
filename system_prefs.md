### Organization Default Settings

As an administrator with **Accounts, Groups & Roles** permission, on the **New User Defaults** tab, you can set Wavefront preferences:

* Globally set whether Getting Started Progress display is the default.
* Set a default landing page - a dashboard that you specify or the dashboard list.
* Set the default query language preferences and optionally allow users to write queries in PromQL. 
* When the default query language is WQL, you can also set whether Query Editor or Chart Builder is the default query builder. 
* Set the default user groups. New users are assigned to all default user groups, and permissions are additive.
* Set the default permissions for new users.
