### Organization Settings

Organization Settings allow users with **Accounts, Groups & Roles** permission to set Wavefront preferences:

**New User Defaults Tab**

Lets you to:

* Globally set whether Getting Started Progress display is the default and set a default landing page -- a dashboard that you specify or the dashboard list.
* Set the default query language preferences and optionally allow users to write queries in PromQL. 
* When the default query language is WQL, you can also set whether Query Editor or Chart Builder is the default query builder. 
* Set the default user groups. New users are assigned to all default user groups, and permissions are additive.
* Set the default permissions for new users.

**Security Tab**

Lets you give access to new dashboards and alerts to Everyone or to the Object Creator. Even if you select Object Creator, the Super Admin user still has access.
