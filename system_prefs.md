### Organization Settings

Organization Settings allow users with **Accounts & Groups** permissions to set Wavefront preferences:

The **New User Defaults** tab has these options:
* Globally set whether Getting Started Progress display and Query Builder are the defaults. Individual users can override those settings.
* Set a default dashboard or defaults to the dashboard list.
* Set default permissions for new users.
* Set default user groups. New users are assigned to all default user groups, and permissions are additive.

The **Security** tab lets you give access to new objects to Everyone (the default) or to the Creator only. Even if you select Creator, the Super Admin user still has access.
