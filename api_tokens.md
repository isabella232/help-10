### View and Manage the API Tokens in Your Organization

As a Super Admin, you can view the API token of any user or service account, examine their usage, and revoke a token, if needed.

**Important:** Revoking a token cannot be undone. Any script that uses a revoked token returns an authorization error.

On the **API Tokens** tab, you can:
* Sort the API tokens by clicking the arrows in the column headers.
* Search and, optionally, save and share your search by using the Search field above the tokens table.
* Filter the API tokens by account type, usage, particular accounts, or your saved search by using the filters on the left.
* Revoke an API token by clicking the ellipsis icon for the token and selecting **Revoke**.
