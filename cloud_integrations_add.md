### Adding a Cloud Integration

Adding a cloud integration requires establishing a trust relationship between Amazon and Wavefront by sharing account IDs and an external ID. The external ID is generated by Wavefront when you select **Set up Amazon Account**.

You start by granting Wavefront read-only access to your Amazon account or by giving more limited permissions.
