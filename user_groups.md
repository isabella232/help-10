### Managing Groups
You must have the **Accounts** permission to create and manage groups.

By default, all service accounts belong to the **Service Accounts** system group, and all user accounts belong to the **Everyone** system group.

From this page, you can:
* Create, edit, or delete groups. You cannot delete a system group.
* Add account to groups and remove accounts from groups. Accounts can be user accounts and service accounts. One account can belong to many groups. You cannot change the members of a system group. 
* Assign roles to groups and revoke roles from groups. You cannot assign permissions to groups. You can change the role assignment of a system group.

You can also select one or more roles on the left to see which groups have that roles.
