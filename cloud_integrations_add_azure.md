### Adding an Azure Cloud Integration

Adding an Azure cloud integration requires establishing a trust relationship between Azure and Wavefront.

1. Log in to your Wavefront instance.
2. Follow the instructions on the left to establish the trust relationship.

The process first creates an Azure Active Directory application that represents Wavefront inside Azure. Then you retrieve information for that application, and paste it into the form on the far left to complete the trust setup.
