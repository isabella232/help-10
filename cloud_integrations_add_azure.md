### Add a Microsoft Azure Cloud Integration

Adding a Microsoft Azure cloud integration requires establishing a trust relationship between Azure and Wavefront.

1. Click the **How to get the Directory ID**, **How to get the Application ID**, and **How to get the Application Secret** links to see the list of steps.
2. Follow the instructions to establish the trust relationship.

The process first creates an Azure Active Directory application that represents Wavefront inside Azure. Then you retrieve information for that application, and paste it into the form on the far left to complete the trust setup.
