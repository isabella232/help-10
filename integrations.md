### What is an Integration?

Wavefront integrations are the link between any system and the Wavefront application. Integration links can be from your system into Wavefront or from Wavefront to an external system: data collector, alert notification, and authentication.

**Integration Categories**<br/>
Integrations are grouped into different categories. Featured, collector, and code instrumentation integrations include all ways to get data into Wavefront: using a collector agent and Wavefront proxy, sending metrics from application code to the proxy, and Wavefront pulling the data from a cloud service.

**VMware**<br/>
VMware integrations allow you to collect and monitor metrics from VMware products.

**Cloud**<br/>
Cloud integrations allow you to collect and monitor metrics from Cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, and so on.

**Alert Notification**<br/>
Alert notification integrations link alerts with incident management systems and notification services.

**Authentication**<br/>

Authentication integrations enable SSO access to Wavefront by linking to authentication providers.
