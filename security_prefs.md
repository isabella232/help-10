### Organization Security Settings

As an administrator with **Accounts, Groups & Roles** permission, on the **Security** tab, you can set access to newly created dashboards and alerts:

* If you select  **Grant Modify Access To: Everyone**, you give access to all user accounts.
* If you select **Grant Modify Access To: Object Creator**, access to new dashboards and new alerts is initially limited to the dashboard creator and the Super Admin users.

A change to the Organization Security Settings applies only to the dashboards and alerts created after the change. 

If you change the setting to **Object Creator**, only new dashboards and alerts have restricted access. If you later change the setting to **Everyone**, all dashboards and alerts that were created while the setting was **Object Creator** keep the restricted access.
